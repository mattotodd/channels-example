# Try out Django Channels today! 

This is an example app demonstrating how to use (and deploy) [Django Channels](http://channels.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). It's a simple real-time chat app â€” like a very, very light-weight Slack. There are a bunch of rooms, and everyone in the same room can chat, in real-time, with each other (using WebSockets).


## To deploy to Heroku:

First, press the Heroku button to deploy the app:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/mattotodd/channels-example)

Once the app [finishes deploying](Screenshot 2016-03-23 12.23.19.png), press *Manage App*, and turn on the worker dyno by pressing the pencil icon and toggling the **on** switch:

![Confirm](Screenshot 2016-03-24 13.26.03.png)

Then you're ready to use the app! You can press the *Open App* button on your Heroku dashboard, and make your own chatroom. For DjangoCon attendees, now you can come back to our booth, show us your app, and we'll give you a brand new pair of limited-edition Heroku socks.
